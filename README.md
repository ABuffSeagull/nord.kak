A [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) colorscheme for Kakoune

![Sample image](/sample.png)

## Installation
[plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak#Installing-color-schemes):
```sh
plug "abuffseagull/nord.kak" theme %{ colorscheme nord }
```
Or just plop `nord.kak` into your `$KAK_CONFIG/colors` folder.

## Open to criticism
Since this is more or less my interpretation for the [colors and palettes](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes),
I'm more than open to suggestions as to better choices for which colors to use where.
